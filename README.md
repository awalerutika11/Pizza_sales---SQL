The main objective of this project is to perform end-to-end data analysis using SQL on a pizza sales dataset to understand customer behavior, revenue trends, product performance, and operational insights.
This project focuses on writing SQL queries ranging from basic to advanced to answer real business questions such as:

What drives maximum revenue?
Which pizzas are most popular?
How does demand vary by time?
Which categories perform best?
What is the cumulative revenue growth?
This project demonstrates strong SQL skills including joins, grouping, subqueries, window functions, CTEs, ranking, and aggregations.
